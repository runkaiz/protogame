INTRODUCTION

Thank you for getting Dialogue engine - text boxes! This manual will help you get started.

The fastest way to get started is probably checking the example objects to see how this engine can be used.
Also, at the end of every script there is a little example of how to use it.

If you want to ask anything or suggest a feature, send an email to me.

------------------------------------------
SCRIPTS

	BASIC SCRIPTS
	
	textbox_create()
	With this script you can create the dialogue.
	
	------------------------
	SETTINGS SCRIPTS
	
	textbox_set()
	With this you can set the style and some settings of the textbox.

	textbox_set_bubble()
	If you call this instead of textbox_set(), you can make the textbox a speech bubble.
	
	textbox_set_speed()
	With this you can set the speed of the dialogue. The default speed is 0.5.
	
	textbox_set_key()
	With this you can choose the keyboard keys used for the dialogue.
	
	textbox_set_sound()
	Choose the sound for the dialogue.
	It could be, for example, a typewriter sound.
	
	------------------------
	STYLING SCRIPTS
	
	textbox_set_sprite()
	With this function you can add your own sprite for the textbox and name box, instead of colored rectangles.
	(The sprite size should be a multiple of 3, for example, 12 or 24).
	
	textbox_set_position()
	Set the position of the textbox, and additionally, the name box and character sprite.
	The textbox automatically fits the view, but if you don't like how it goes, you can change it with this.
	
	------------------------
	OPTIONS SCRIPTS
	
	textbox_add_options()
	Add up to 3 options.
	
	textbox_change_message_according_option()
	Change one message depending on what option the player chooses.
	
	textbox_change_var_at_end()
	Change a variable when the dialogue ends.
	You could use this, for example, to know if the player has spoken to a npc or not.
	
	chooses_option()
	Checks what option the player chooses. You can use it to change something (for example a variable).
	For an example, see the object: example_npc3.
	
	OTHER SCRIPTS
	
	textbox_exists()
	Checks if the textbox exists.
	Call it before using textbox_create(). For example:
	if !textbox_exists() {
		textbox_create("Hello.");
	}
	
	textbox_hide() and textbox_is_visible()
	textbox_is_visible() checks if the textbox is visible or not and textbox_hide() can be used to hide or show the textbox.
	For example:
	if textbox_exists() {
		if keyboard_check_pressed(vk_escape) {
			if textbox_is_visible() {
				textbox_hide(true);
			}else{
				textbox_hide(false);
			}
		}
	}
	
	textbox_show_backlog() && textbox_backlog_visible()
	textbox_backlog_visible() checks if the backlog is visible or not.
	textbox_show_backlog() shows or hides the backlog.
	
	
---------------------------------
USING DIALOGUE ENGINE WITH CUTSCENE ENGINE
I have also made a cutscene engine (https://marketplace.yoyogames.com/assets/8241/cutscene-engine).
It uses some of the same scripts and objects as the dialogue engine. When importing these scripts and objects, you can replace the duplicates.
Regarding the option objects, if you use both dialogue & cutscene engine, you have to uncomment a certain part from the option_object1, option_object2 & option_object3.

---------------------------------
OTHER THINGS
You can ignore the textbox object. It manages itself. You can also ignore the internal scipts.

I'm planning to add instructions here on how to use this in different type of games (for example, in a visual novel).
